# 31728-HYBRID-AND-EMBEDDED-CONTROL-IN-ENERGY-SYSTEMS

Collection of code for the 3 week course at DTU.

"Final" contains the final code, controlling a EV's charging

"TinkercadArduinoCode" contains code from the warmup projects provided by thinkercad

"snakke" contains a project that takes voice input and prints it on a LCD screen.
This utilises voice reconition, web-sockets, and communication between the arduino 
and a processing script.

The rest is just junk :)
